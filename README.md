# Curriculum

A curated guide for beginners to start their learning journey. [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/fnplus/curriculum.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/fnplus/curriculum)

# Introduction

These are the essential skills that each individual starting with FnPlus Bootcamp(s) must be familiar with. We have made this resource library by creating our own internal content and by curating our favorite blog posts, documentation sites, courses & videos from around the web.

Here, you have access to resources which will help you understand the general programming concepts as well as the specifics of various technologies in depth.

The repository is arranged as follows:

> **Domain** / **Sub domain** / **Resource file**

Each folder has a README.md file containing all information about the folder, it's contents and resource links.

 **Courses must**:

- Be open for enrollment

- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running at least once a month or so)

- Fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to topics and difficulty level

- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

### Motivation & Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

- [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.
